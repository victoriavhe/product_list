## About the api_call.dart
///I used to break down services into three packages/classes for each
///one for endpoints - listing all endpoints
///one for api - handling the http call of a certain api
///one for repository - handling the api call in a simpler way to be used on bloc

///and for the http call/ headers/ 
///i used to put it on a class name http_helper 
///and put the url base on a different class as well (i.e url_base.dart)
///so that it will be easier if we need to manage the data.

///because this is a simple app,
///i want to keep it simple, so i put it on one class instead to break it down.
///i think for this case study, this approach, will be easier to manage.


//ps : sometimes i takes seconds to load based on the internet speed.
